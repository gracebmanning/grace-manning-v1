#### 1 - Assignment Points Completed
I believe I have completed all 14 assignment points.

#### 2 - HTML, CSS, Advanced Content
* HTML content: images with alt attributes, appropriate headings (h tags) and paragraph text (p tags), links to external pages, multiple pages, semantic HTML tags (nav tag), custom icons
* CSS content: padding, margins, color, custom fonts, flexbox
* Advanced feature: complex page layout (navigation bar), nested CSS selectors

#### 3 - Length of Time Spent on Assignment
I'm not sure how to answer this one, since I've technically been working on this website and making improvements for almost a year.

In regards to this assignment, I tweaked a few things to improve the responsiveness, such as in the Fortune Teller page and the About section. I also improved the smoothness of the hover transitions on the icons in the Contact section. Overall, I think I spent about 2 hours making small changes.

#### 4 - Online Resources Consulted
These are some of my favorites that I often refer to:
* [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
* [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)
* [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
* I typically use [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to refresh my memory on something or find a better way to create a component.

#### 5 - Classmates or Other Individuals Consulted
I did not speak to anyone the changes I made to my website other than bouncing ideas off of my roommate (who is a Psychology major and is not in this class).
